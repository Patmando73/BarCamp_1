        <h2>At BarCamp, you don't have to be an expert to give a talk</h2>
        <p>You just have to be passionate. At BarCamp, you won't find a predetermined speaker list or a line of
            suits passing out business cards. What you will ifnd is some shaggy dude in a t-shirt talking about
            moonshine, a web developer talking about the best practices in SEO, or a world traveler sharing their
            experiences. BarCamp is a chance to network, learn something new, and communicate what you're most
            passionate about. Come one, come all.</p>
